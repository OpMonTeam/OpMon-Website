**OpMon** is a Pokemon inspired open-source game. Go on an adventure filled with
exploration and various monsters in the wonderful region of Regimys!

The game was imagined in 2012 and was made a reality in 2016 by a very small
team of fans. The game is free and the source code is open to all, so you can
come help us and improve the game!

# Features

* OpMon is developed by a team exclusively composed of volunteers. As such, the
  game is distributed for free. We ask for nothing but your hapiness!
* OpMon is entirely open source (under the **GPL-3.0** license), and we even use
  open source software to create it: Linux, Code::Blocks, Gimp, Git and many
  others!
* OpMon is developed by fans, for fans. The game contains plenty of small Easter
  eggs in reference to the Nintendo universe while adding new features that give
  a breath of fresh air to the license.
