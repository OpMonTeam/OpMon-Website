We finally caught up the C++ version with the new Godot one! For this occasion, the repository has been reorganized and a lot of things have changed. We also released Alpha 0.2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/37&quot;&gt;monthly report of March 2022&lt;/a&gt;, since yes, monthly reports are back! Except this first one, all monthly reports will also be posted on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

We wanted to transition from
the old one since some time now, and the recent progress on the Godot version of
OpMon gave us the perfect occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, as some of you may be aware we recently switched from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfml-dev.org/&quot;&gt;SFML&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://godotengine.org/&quot;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; to develop OpMon. We’re currently getting
up to speed with the old version of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to keep you updated with the development progress, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>OpMon Team</name></author><summary type="html">Hello everyone, and welcome to OpMon new website!
