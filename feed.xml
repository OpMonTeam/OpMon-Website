There is still some progress done during Mars and some in April, and I think the things to do for the next version will be done next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-game&quot;&gt;In the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re moving forwards! The big news: the in-game menu and the team management screens are done. Now you can reorganise your team and change your first OpMon. However, the battle system still doesn’t take the team into account, except for the first OpMon that will be the one launch (so you can choose the OpMon you start the test battle with). That’s something that will be added this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Euvi Town map has been completely revamped! Feel free to test it a bit. Talking of maps, thanks to @alkaloid99 the game now has a really great player’s house and room. @Kuromeruk also mirrored the map and created the rival’s house and room: Euvi Town is nearly on par with the C++ version. Thanks a lot to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish this part, @HasJamOn also participated to the game by doing some quality of life modifications: adding controller mapping, mapping WSAD to ui controls and increasing the character’s speed. This last change is not definitive, but it’s really useful while the game is developing. We’ll change it back when the running shoes are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-future&quot;&gt;In the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I’ll do is working on modifying the battle system to add team support. There will also be @Kuromeruk that will be working on issue #33 to add animations for the moves. When these modifications are done, only issue #40 with the save load system will remain before releasing version Alpha 0.3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-my-life&quot;&gt;In my life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I said, I was quite busy last month but my studies are now finished! So I’ll have a lot more free time. I don’t think I’ll work on OpMon every day though, but I’ll have definitely the time to work at least around ten hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for following the development of OpMon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>OpMon Team</name></author><summary type="html">April has been a pretty busy month for me.

&lt;p&gt;For more information, you can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/37&quot;&gt;monthly report of March 2022&lt;/a&gt;, since yes, monthly reports are back! Except this first one, all monthly reports will also be posted on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

We wanted to transition from
the old one since some time now, and the recent progress on the Godot version of
OpMon gave us the perfect occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, as some of you may be aware we recently switched from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfml-dev.org/&quot;&gt;SFML&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://godotengine.org/&quot;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; to develop OpMon. We’re currently getting
up to speed with the old version of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll try to keep you updated with the development progress, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>OpMon Team</name></author><summary type="html">Hello everyone, and welcome to OpMon new website!
