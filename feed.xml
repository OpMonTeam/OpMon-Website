&lt;p&gt;If you still want to contribute, I’ll still be able to check pull requests and issues, and answer your questions here or on the Discord server. I will not, however, contribute anything to the game myself in the meanwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-game&quot;&gt;In the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much, to be honest. More details in the next two categories. However, I’ve taken some time to think about some elements of the game and started to work on items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-future&quot;&gt;In the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godot 4.0 is out in beta, and I’ll try to upgrade the current code when I’ll have some spare time. There’s especially some changes to GDScript I’m excited to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game itself, I’ll continue working on the items when the upgrade will be finished. Then, I’ll continue the roadmap for the next version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-my-life&quot;&gt;In my life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My summer has been quite active, but now I’m back to my studies and, well… I have less time that ever. In parallel, I’ve been hired as a teacher, so even less time for me. I don’t have a lot of time for my personal projects. Since it’s the beginning of the period, I might be able to find a way to handle doing my studies, my work AND my personal projects. I hope so, we’ll see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for following the development of OpMon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>OpMon Team</name></author><summary type="html">Summer’s over, back to work!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Development report – Summer 2022</title><link href="/2022/06/11/dev-report-summer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Development report – Summer 2022" /><published>2022-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-06-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/2022/06/11/dev-report-summer</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/06/11/dev-report-summer.html">&lt;p&gt;Alpha 0.3 has been released!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-game&quot;&gt;In the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/discussions/49&quot;&gt;Alpha 0.3 announcement&lt;/a&gt; to see what has been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-future&quot;&gt;In the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll now start working on the Alpha 0.4, you can find the roadmap &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/OpMonTeam/projects/11&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll first search for new tiles on the Internet to improve Euvi Town, then I’ll work on the items!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been thinking last weeks, and as you can see this development report is quite empty. To be honest, I’m not working on this game as often as a professional would do, so I don’t think monthly development reports are required. However, I still think it’s important to give news regularly, so I’ll still do development reports, but every season. Consider this the development report of the summer solstice, and we’ll see again at the autumnal equinox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-my-life&quot;&gt;In my life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I haven’t worked on the game since the last release (personal issues), the working rhythm I had during May seemed right to me and I think I’ll try to continue like this when I can. However, some important events will be happening for me in the next months, and I don’t think I’ll work at all from the last week of June until the start of August (maybe one or two commits if I crave developing the game and have the time). I’ll be completely free again during August until September (when I’ll start a new year of studies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for following the development of OpMon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>OpMon Team</name></author><summary type="html">Alpha 0.3 has been released!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Alpha 0.3 now released!</title><link href="/2022/05/27/alpha-0.3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Alpha 0.3 now released!" /><published>2022-05-27T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-27T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/2022/05/27/alpha-0.3</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2022/05/27/alpha-0.3.html">&lt;p&gt;This release adds a major feature: teams. The player now has a team they can manage in the team management screen (that can be found in the Game Menu, an in-game menu that can be accessed by pressing the Escape key, note that the assigned key is temporary). The only management feature available now is the reorganisation of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the addition of teams, the battles are now over only when a full team is defeated. You can also change OpMon in battle and choose another one when the previous one is K.O. Your opponent will also change OpMon when the previous one is defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two other important additions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Animated moves by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Kuromeruk&quot;&gt;@Kuromeruk&lt;/a&gt;, moves are now nicely animated when used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primitive save and load feature by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cyriellecentori&quot;&gt;@cyriellecentori&lt;/a&gt;, better described in the associated pull request &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpMonTeam/OpMon/pull/55&quot;&gt;#55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HasJamOn&quot;&gt;@HasJamOn&lt;/a&gt; for useful quality of life features and improvements and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alkaloid99&quot;&gt;@alkaloid99&lt;/a&gt; for adding two maps, the player’s house and room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as always, thank you for following the development of OpMon.&lt;/p&gt;

There is still some progress done during Mars and some in April, and I think the things to do for the next version will be done next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-game&quot;&gt;In the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re moving forwards! The big news: the in-game menu and the team management screens are done. Now you can reorganise your team and change your first OpMon. However, the battle system still doesn’t take the team into account, except for the first OpMon that will be the one launch (so you can choose the OpMon you start the test battle with). That’s something that will be added this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Euvi Town map has been completely revamped! Feel free to test it a bit. Talking of maps, thanks to @alkaloid99 the game now has a really great player’s house and room. @Kuromeruk also mirrored the map and created the rival’s house and room: Euvi Town is nearly on par with the C++ version. Thanks a lot to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish this part, @HasJamOn also participated to the game by doing some quality of life modifications: adding controller mapping, mapping WSAD to ui controls and increasing the character’s speed. This last change is not definitive, but it’s really useful while the game is developing. We’ll change it back when the running shoes are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-future&quot;&gt;In the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I’ll do is working on modifying the battle system to add team support. There will also be @Kuromeruk that will be working on issue #33 to add animations for the moves. When these modifications are done, only issue #40 with the save load system will remain before releasing version Alpha 0.3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-my-life&quot;&gt;In my life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I said, I was quite busy last month but my studies are now finished! So I’ll have a lot more free time. I don’t think I’ll work on OpMon every day though, but I’ll have definitely the time to work at least around ten hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;
